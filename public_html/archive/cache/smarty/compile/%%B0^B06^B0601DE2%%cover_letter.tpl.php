<p>Every job you apply for should include a covering letter. This is a professional way of introducing yourself and pique's the employer's interest. Bear in mind that the covering letter should be a summary of yourself and not an essay. Don't bore your potential employer before he/she has even looked at your CV.<br><br>The covering letter should give an insight into your character, where a CV might be lacking. The longer your experience, the shorter and more direct your covering letter should be.<br><br>
</p>
	<span class="blue_text">Should include:</span>
		<ul>
			<li>Why you are writing eg. I am writing in application for the position of ... </li>
			<li>Why they should consider hiring you </li>
			<li>Give a brief summary of your experience and qualifications </li>
		</ul>
	<span class="blue_text">Some tips on writing an effective cover letter</span>
		<ul>
			<li>Make it personal - reflecting your personality </li>
			<li>Research the company - this shows initiative and interest in the position and is sure to impress </li>
			<li>Never mention salary at this stage </li>
			<li>Use a P.S. Although this is often classed as unprofessional, a P.S. is always noticeable and more often than not, will be read. </li>
			<li>Ask your friends or family to read your letter thoroughly, checking for spelling and grammar, and ask them for their honest opinion as to whether they would hire you after reading it.</li>
