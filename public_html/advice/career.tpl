					<h1>Choosing a Career</h1>					
				</div>
				<p>For many of us, finding a career that we deem fun and long-term is in itself a long journey. But having a successful career in life is not just for the rich and famous, it's also for the average person, like you!<p>
				<p>We as humans are prone to look at successful individuals like Oprah or Bill Gates and assume that somehow they became wealthy and innovative overnight, but it truly took many years, time, effort, and perseverance. </p>
				<p>There are three important points to address when asking the question, what career is right for me?</p>
				<p class="bissubhead">Know yourself</p>
				<p>Firstly, you must discover what are those standing and lasting values that make you who you are. What things interest you or what things make you want to stop as soon as you begin. Choosing a career is all about you, because if you don't know who you are as an individual, it's going to be extremely hard to convince your potential employer to entrust you with a job. </p>
				<p>For some of us, we value our families and the ability to schedule work around life or for some it may be the need to work around certain types of people, rather than others. Whatever those values and ideals fit you, you must be comfortable with yourself and willing to try new things! </p>
			  <p class="bissubhead">What are your abilities?</p>
				<p>Secondly, you must figure out what you are good at and what brings out the best of your abilities. Obviously, if you are great at painting artwork, but really can't stand working outside in the scorching heat, then you probably don't want to apply for a job as a car mechanic. </p>
				<p>There are many ways to figure out what you are good at, simply just by asking yourself what are your likes and dislikes, your expectations for your dream career, and what steps you would have to take to get there. </p>
				<p>Whenever someone comes up to me and complains about their job and how they dislike it so much, I always ask why you are still doing it. Work in a field that fits your mold and who you are, not based on pay or some other factor. </p>
				<p class="bissubhead">Do something you love!</p>
				<p>Thirdly and most importantly, do something you love! Never get lured into doing a job that makes you grumpy and angry at the world. There are too many career positions out there waiting for someone with your talents to come aboard. </p>
				<p>Happiness in career and life to me is one of the most vital issues we should all cherish as human beings. Being happy is not only good for those who spend the most time with you, such as your spouse, kids, or friends, it's also good for your health, happiness, and well-being. Like I said before, a great career is not just for the rich and famous, it's for all of us. </p>
				<p>Some of us have wealthy parents and can just inherit money or work for them, while others have to work their hardest to earn a decent living. But whatever the case may be, your dreams and goals can come true in life, no matter your age, race, or any other factor. Just remember to set goals, aim high, and never give up! You have to be willing to be an innovator and a visionist in your quest to find that dream career. In the words of Robert Byrne, "The purpose of life is a life of purpose." </p>
