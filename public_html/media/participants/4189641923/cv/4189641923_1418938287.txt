Meeting Minutes

Initially this meeting was to discuss the small changes needed on the new logo designed by claud as well as setup the email account for Neo to be able to start working, but I had a couple of question which made the meeting even longer.

Some of the issues discussed were:

Items to note

    Neo has been given a temporary place to use as our address on the business card which is in cape town cbd.
    The launch on the 15th of August will be a formal affair and is yet to be planned properly before time.
    All basework before looking for sponsors need to be done on the 15th of July 2014.

Corporate Identity

The deadline for the completion of this is the 15th of July 2014. Corporate Identity comprises of the following:

    Logo design
    Email signatures
    Email mailers
    Letter head
    Business cards
    Email accounts
    Domain registration
    "Coming Soon" home page
    Cost estimate for the website after launch from Willow-Nettica

ï»¿Organization Launch

Because we are pressed with time, the launch date for the organization is the 15th of August 2014. The date is tight because of the fact of competition as well as having promised people who promised us for donations, it can however changed if there is a situation that needs it to do so.

The event will be a formal one where between the completion of the corporate identity and the launch Neo would have gathered enough people to come to it as well as to sponsor it.

For finding sponsors Neo will ask for the services of Arifa Parker who used to work with him at the Cape Business Chamber of Commerce. The idea was that she looks for sponsors in her pool of contacts for us and she earns an agreed upon percentage of what she gets. Neo committed to seeing or contacting her on Wednesday (2nd of July 2014)

Before the 15th of July, we need to have identified about 20 people who would serve on the board, this includes the chairperson, the portfolio committee to the leaders of the provinces.
