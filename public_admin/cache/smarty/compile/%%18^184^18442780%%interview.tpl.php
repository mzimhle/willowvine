					<h1>Interview techniques</h1>					
				</div>
				<p>You've got an interview. Now you just have to convince your potential employer that you are the right person for the job. Here's how.</p>
				<p>No matter how qualified you are, how much experience you have and how well suited for the job you are - if you aren't able to interview successfully, you won't get the job. We have put together some helpful interview techniques which will help you in landing the job you want. <p>
				<p>Treat every interview as if it were the only one you will ever get with that company and your only opportunity to convince them that you are the right candidate for the position. </p>
				<p>The key element to successful interviewing is attitude. If you have the attitude of wanting to do your very best for the company, of being focused on the company's needs, of putting yourself forward as the person who will be committed and dedicated to fulfilling their needs, you will likely be the one chosen for the job. </p>
				<p class="bissubhead">Pre-Interview</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Why you are writing eg. I am writing in application for the position of ... </li>
					<li>Why they should consider hiring you </li>
					<li>Give a brief summary of your experience and qualifications </li>
				</ul>	
			  <p class="bissubhead">Some tips on writing an effective cover letter</p>
				<p>Before your interview research everything you can about the company (visit their website or read their annual report). Re-read your application and the job advertisement, thinking through your own career and the questions they might ask you. You should try to anticipate the general questions which they will ask and also prepare some questions to ask them. (see below for some examples of questions you can expect to be asked and can ask) </p>
				<p>Take extra copies of your CV, a typewritten list of your references with their addresses and phone numbers, and any work samples you may want to present. </p>
				<p>Arrive 5 to 10 minutes early for the interview and behave professionally while waiting in the reception area. </p>
				<p class="bissubhead">Dress</p>
				<p>The rule of thumb in dressing for the interview is to dress professionally and conservatively. If you have done your research, you should have an idea of the company's work ethic which should give you an idea of how to dress appropriately. </p>
				<p>However, stay away from trendy clothing, flashy jewelry, perfumes or colognes, and heavy make-up. The image should be toned down and professional. There may be some exceptions to this, in fields that involve fashion or entertainment, for example. First impressions, while they can't substitute for sound preparation are, nonetheless, highly important. Decisions are sometimes made in the first minute or so of the interview. </p>
